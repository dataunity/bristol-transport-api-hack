# Bristol Transport API Hackday
Code for the Bristol Transport API hackday on 23rd Jan 2016.

Displays routes between two points by using the Route Planner part of the API. 
Works out the cost of each of the journeys in terms of time, health, environmental 
impact and money (only time is implemented at the moment).

Currently working off data manually pulled from the API, needs to be updated to make a real call to the real API.
